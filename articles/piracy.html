      <h2>The Last Piracy Guide You'll Ever Need</h2>
      <p>
        This is intended to be the last piracy guide you'll ever need. As
        someone who is a huge advocate for piracy, I am using my platform as a
        way to teach everyone on how to pirate. I am a strong believer that if
        buying /=/ owning, then piracy /=/ stealing. So here's an aggregated
        list of trustworthy websites and software to pirate with. Pirate on my
        friends.
      </p>
      <h3>VPNs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a></li> - Arguably the best VPN
          available (<a
            href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/4/20/mullvad-vpn-was-subject-to-a-search-warrant-customer-data-not-compromised"
            >¹</a
          >), but doesn't support port forwarding. Based in Sweden.
        <li>
          <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a></li> - Supports port
          forwarding, based in Switzerland.
      </ul>
      <h3>Torrent Clients</h3>
      <p>
        Only recommendation I have is
        <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a> (<a
          href="https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent"
          >open-source btw</a
        >). It's essentially the standard now. Do <strong>NOT</strong> use
        µTorrent or BitTorrent. They're known to ship with adware, cryptominers,
        and spyware.

          >¹</a
        >
        <h3>Software Sites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://w14.monkrus.ws/">m0nkrus</a></li> - Trusted Adobe software site. Windows only.
            <li><a href="https://massgrave.dev/">MAS (Microsoft Activation Scripts)</a></li> - Your all-in-one solution to activating Windows & Microsoft Office, 
        </ul>
        <h3>Games</h3>
        <h4>Repackers</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site/">FitGirl Repacks</a></li> - One of the most well known and reputable repackers out there. They provide Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Install time can be dependent on the hardware in your computer.
            <li><a href="https://dodi-repacks.site/">DODI Repacks</a></li> - Another active repacker that provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. May take less time to install compared to FitGirl, coming at a cost with slightly larger releases.
        </ul>
        <h4>DDL</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://gog-games.to/">GOG Games</a></li> - GOG DRM-free Games, ripped and re-uploaded on Mirrors. Every installer is untouched and has SHA-256 hashes from GOG.
            <li><a href="https://gamesdrive.net/">GamesDrive</a></li> - Re-uploads Repacks, P2P Cracks and Scene Releases to various hosts. Also take requests.
        </ul>
